/**
 * Regression test for issue #2100: omp startup blocked >25s while connecting
 * to MCP servers.
 *
 * The scenario: a configured MCP server is reachable at the transport layer
 * but never answers `initialize`. Before the fix `MCPManager.connectServers`
 * awaited every still-pending server that had no cached tools with an
 * unbounded `Promise.allSettled`, so the slowest server's per-request timeout
 * (`OMP_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 30 000 ms) gated the entire UI.
 *
 * Contract this test defends: when an MCP server stalls and has no cached
 * tools, `connectServers` MUST return inside the bounded startup window
 * (currently `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS = 250 ms`, padded here for scheduling
 * jitter) so the rest of session bring-up — model registry, prompt setup,
 * UI ready signal — is not gated on slow/dead servers. The slow server is
 * left in flight; its tools surface via the background `#onToolsChanged`
 * path if/when it eventually connects.
