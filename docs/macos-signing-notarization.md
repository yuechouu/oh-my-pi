# macOS signing & notarization

The compiled macOS `omp` binaries shipped on GitHub Releases are signed with a
**Developer ID Application** certificate and **notarized** by Apple. This makes
them Gatekeeper-acceptable and is the prerequisite for an official Homebrew
submission (see [#776](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/776)).

Signing happens in CI, in the `release_binary` job's darwin matrix legs
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), via `scripts/ci-macos-sign.sh`. It **auto-skips**
until the `APPLE_*` repository secrets below are configured, so releases keep
working (ad-hoc signed, as before) in the meantime.

## How it works

1. `ci:release:build-binaries` builds and **ad-hoc** signs the binary (so it can
   run on the build runner).
2. `scripts/ci-macos-sign.sh` then:
   - imports the Developer ID cert into a throwaway keychain;
   - re-signs with `--options runtime --timestamp` (hardened runtime + secure
     timestamp) and `--entitlements scripts/macos-entitlements.plist`;
   - runs `--version` and `--smoke-test` under the new signature to fail fast;
   - notarizes the binary via `notarytool submit --wait`.
3. `release_github_verify` re-downloads the published arm64 asset and asserts it
   is **not** ad-hoc, passes `codesign --verify --strict`, and boots cleanly.

### Why the entitlements are mandatory

The binary is a Bun single-file executable, so the hardened runtime needs:

| Entitlement | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` | JavaScriptCore JITs at runtime. |
| `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` | JSC executable memory pages. |
| `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` | omp extracts its native addon (`pi_natives.<triple>.node`) and other optional dylibs to a runtime cache and `dlopen()`s them. They do not share the main binary's Team ID, so without this the hardened runtime aborts with *"mapping process and mapped file have different Team IDs"* — breaking effectively every command. |

Without `disable-library-validation`, a signed+notarized binary signs and
notarizes fine but **fails at first real use**. `scripts/ci-macos-sign.sh` runs
`--smoke-test` after signing specifically to catch this before notarizing.

### Stapling limitation (important)

A bare Mach-O executable **cannot be stapled** (`stapler` only supports
`.app`/`.pkg`/`.dmg`). The binary is genuinely notarized — `notarytool` returns
`Accepted` and the ticket exists on Apple's servers keyed to its cdhash — but
because there is no *stapled* ticket, a direct `spctl -a -t exec` assessment
reports `rejected / source=Unnotarized Developer ID`. This is expected and is
**not** a signing or credential failure.

What this means in practice:

- `curl https://omp.sh/install | sh` — `curl` sets no quarantine bit, so
  Gatekeeper is never consulted; the binary just runs. ✅
- Homebrew **formula** installs — Homebrew does not quarantine formula files, so
  Gatekeeper is never consulted. ✅
- Anything that **quarantines** the binary (a browser download, or a Homebrew
  **cask**) and is assessed offline will be blocked, because there is no stapled
  ticket. For that route, wrap the binary in a stapleable, notarized **`.pkg` or
  `.dmg`** (`xcrun stapler staple` works on those). That is a follow-up and is
  **not** required for the `curl`/formula paths.

## Required GitHub secrets

Add these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** (repo secrets).
Both the cert (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`) **and** the API key (`APPLE_API_KEY`)
must be present for signing to engage.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` | base64 of the exported Developer ID Application `.p12` (cert + private key). |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | password you set when exporting the `.p12`. |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API **Key ID**. |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect API **Issuer ID** (UUID). |
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | base64 of the App Store Connect `.p8` private key. |

### Producing the credential files

Drop these into a working directory (default `~/omp-signing`):

| File | How |
| --- | --- |
| `*.p12` | **Keychain Access** → right-click your *Developer ID Application: …* identity (the entry that expands to a cert **with** a private key) → **Export…** → save as `.p12` and set a password. |
| `p12-password.txt` | the password you just set on the `.p12`. |
| `AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8` | App Store Connect → **Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API** → create a key (**Account Holder** role also allows API cert creation; **Developer** is enough for notarization) → **download once** (non-recoverable). |
| `issuer-id.txt` | the **Issuer ID** (UUID) shown above the keys table. |
| `key-id.txt` | *optional* — the Key ID; otherwise read from the `.p8` filename. |

The App Store Connect API key is the one credential that **cannot** be minted
from a CLI — it is the bootstrap credential for the API itself, and the `.p8`
downloads exactly once. Everything else is local.

### Uploading (no value leaves disk)

`scripts/ci-macos-upload-secrets.sh` validates the files (opens the `.p12` with
your password, sanity-checks the `.p8`) and pipes each value to `gh secret set`
over stdin — no secret is ever printed to the terminal, argv, or shell history:

```sh
scripts/ci-macos-upload-secrets.sh ~/omp-signing --dry-run   # validate first
scripts/ci-macos-upload-secrets.sh ~/omp-signing             # upload all five
gh secret list --repo can1357/oh-my-pi                       # confirm
```

Re-run it whenever the certificate is renewed.

### Finding your signing identity / Team ID (sanity check)

```sh
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
# e.g. "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID1234)"
```

The script selects the first `Developer ID Application` identity automatically;
you do not need to store the identity string or Team ID as a secret.

## Local dry run

You can exercise the full sign+notarize path locally (real cert + API key) by
exporting the five env vars and running:

```sh
RELEASE_TARGETS=darwin-arm64 bun run ci:release:build-binaries
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12=… APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=… \
APPLE_API_KEY_ID=… APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID=… APPLE_API_KEY=… \
  bash scripts/ci-macos-sign.sh packages/coding-agent/binaries/omp-darwin-arm64
```
